Making group dining decisions easier.

This project will utilize different business search API's to contruct a survey. From there the answers will be collected, analyzed, and sent to the Foursquare API. Two to three retaurant results will come back for the same survey party to make one final vote. The winning retaurant will appear on the screen with location details, distance, and possibly a menu.
