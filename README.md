Making group dining decisions easier.

This project will utilize different business search API's to contruct a survey. The survey will have three questions: (1)Cuisine, (2) distance, (3) price tier. From there the answers will be collected, analyzed, and sent to the Foursquare API. When the JSON response comes back we will filter the top three retaurant results that best match the survey responses. 
These three restaurants will be presented back to the same survey group for one final vote. Each of the three restaurants will have a drop down for each restaurant that displays for more information. 

The final restaurant will be presented on the screen.
